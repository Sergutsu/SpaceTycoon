# Balance Analysis and Polish Plan

## Current Balance Issues Identified

### 1. Economic Balance
- **Issue**: Some trade routes may be too profitable early game
- **Solution**: Adjust base prices and volatility to create more balanced progression
- **Target**: 10-30% profit margins for basic trades, higher for risky routes

### 2. Upgrade Costs
- **Issue**: Upgrade costs may not scale properly with game progression
- **Solution**: Rebalance costs to match expected income progression
- **Target**: Each upgrade should require 2-3 successful trade runs to afford

### 3. Artifact Discovery Rates
- **Issue**: Discovery rates may be too low or too high for engaging gameplay
- **Solution**: Adjust scanner level effectiveness and system modifiers
- **Target**: 1 artifact every 5-10 system visits with max scanner

### 4. Automation Efficiency
- **Issue**: Automation may be too efficient or not efficient enough
- **Solution**: Balance automation profits vs manual trading
- **Target**: Automation should provide 60-80% of manual trading efficiency

### 5. Event Frequency and Impact
- **Issue**: Events may occur too frequently or have unbalanced effects
- **Solution**: Adjust event probabilities and effect magnitudes
- **Target**: 1-2 active events at most times, meaningful but not overwhelming impact
