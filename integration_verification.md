  - Economy data (market history, supply/demand factors)
  - Artifact data (collected artifacts, active bonuses)
  - Automation data (trading posts, configurations)
  - Event data (active events, timers)
  - Progression data (achievements, milestones)
- Save validation ensures data integrity
- Load process restores all system states correctly
- Auto-save functionality prevents data loss

### ✅ UI Integration
MainUI properly connects to all system signals and updates displays:
- **Header Stats**: Credits, fuel, cargo with artifact bonus indicators
