# UI Scene Architecture Refactor - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to refactor the current UI system from programmatic UI creation to proper Godot scene-based architecture. Currently, many UI elements are created dynamically in scripts, which goes against Godot best practices and makes the UI harder to maintain, debug, and modify.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Scene-Based UI Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI elements to be defined in scene files (.tscn) so that I can visually design and modify the interface using Godot's editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any UI panel THEN all visual elements SHALL be defined in .tscn scene files
2. WHEN opening a UI scene in Godot editor THEN all UI components SHALL be visible and editable in the scene tree
3. WHEN modifying UI layout THEN changes SHALL be made through the Godot editor, not code
4. IF a UI element needs to be created dynamically THEN it SHALL use scene instantiation, not programmatic node creation

### Requirement 2: Script Logic Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want scripts to contain only business logic and event handling, not UI creation code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any UI script THEN it SHALL NOT contain calls to `new()` for UI node creation
2. WHEN a script needs to reference UI elements THEN it SHALL use `@onready var` with `get_node()` or `$` syntax
3. WHEN UI elements need dynamic behavior THEN scripts SHALL modify properties, not create new nodes
4. WHEN complex UI interactions are needed THEN they SHALL be handled through signals and method calls

### Requirement 3: SimpleHUD Scene Conversion

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SimpleHUD to be defined as a proper scene file with all elements visible in the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SimpleHUD is loaded THEN all UI elements SHALL be defined in SimpleHUD.tscn
2. WHEN examining SimpleHUD.gd THEN it SHALL contain no `_create_ui_elements()` method
3. WHEN the HUD displays stats THEN it SHALL update existing scene elements, not create new ones
4. WHEN alerts are shown THEN they SHALL use pre-defined alert containers from the scene

### Requirement 4: Panel Scene Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI panels to follow a consistent scene structure pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any panel scene THEN it SHALL have a root Control node with the panel's class script attached
2. WHEN a panel needs sub-components THEN they SHALL be organized in logical container nodes
3. WHEN panels need styling THEN they SHALL use Godot's theme system, not programmatic StyleBox creation
4. WHEN panels are instantiated THEN they SHALL work immediately without requiring setup methods

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Content Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dynamic content (like alerts, market data, notifications) to use scene templates rather than programmatic creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dynamic content needs to be displayed THEN it SHALL use scene templates (.tscn files)
2. WHEN lists need to be populated THEN they SHALL instantiate item scenes, not create nodes programmatically
3. WHEN content needs to be removed THEN it SHALL use `queue_free()` on scene instances
4. WHEN content templates are needed THEN they SHALL be stored as separate .tscn files

### Requirement 6: UIManager Scene Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UIManager to work with scene-based panels without creating UI elements programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UIManager initializes THEN it SHALL reference existing scene-based panels
2. WHEN UIManager creates helper UI (like help overlay) THEN it SHALL instantiate scene files
3. WHEN UIManager applies themes THEN it SHALL use Godot's built-in theme system
4. WHEN UIManager handles panel docking THEN it SHALL work with scene-based Control nodes

### Requirement 7: Maintainability and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to debug and modify UI elements using Godot's built-in tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging UI issues THEN all elements SHALL be visible in the Remote Inspector
2. WHEN modifying UI appearance THEN changes SHALL be previewable in the Godot editor
3. WHEN UI elements have problems THEN they SHALL be identifiable by name in the scene tree
4. WHEN performance profiling THEN UI elements SHALL be properly categorized in the profiler

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored UI to maintain all existing functionality while improving the architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all existing UI features SHALL work identically
2. WHEN panels are displayed THEN they SHALL have the same visual appearance as before
3. WHEN user interactions occur THEN they SHALL behave exactly as in the current system
4. WHEN game state changes THEN UI updates SHALL continue to work as expected

## Success Criteria

- All UI elements are defined in .tscn scene files
- No UI creation code remains in scripts (except scene instantiation)
- All panels can be edited visually in Godot editor
- UI debugging is improved through proper scene structure
- Performance is maintained or improved
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Code is more maintainable and follows Godot best practices

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with existing GameManager integration
- Must preserve all current UI themes and styling
- Must not break existing keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- Must maintain performance characteristics
- Must work with existing save/load panel state functionality
