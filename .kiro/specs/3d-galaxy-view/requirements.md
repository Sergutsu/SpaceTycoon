# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the current 2D galaxy map into an immersive 3D space environment using only primitive shapes and basic colors. This will provide a more engaging spatial experience for players while maintaining the core trading game mechanics. The 3D galaxy view should use simple geometric primitives (spheres, cubes, etc.) with solid colors to represent stars, planets, and the player's ship, creating a clean minimalist aesthetic that focuses on gameplay rather than visual complexity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view the galaxy in 3D space, so that I can better understand the spatial relationships between planets and plan my trade routes more intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a 3D galaxy scene with planets positioned in 3D space
2. WHEN viewing the galaxy THEN the system SHALL use only primitive shapes (spheres for planets/stars, simple geometric shapes for ships)
3. WHEN displaying celestial objects THEN the system SHALL use solid colors without textures or complex materials
4. WHEN the player views the galaxy THEN the system SHALL maintain the same planet data and trade information as the current 2D version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate the 3D galaxy view with intuitive camera controls, so that I can explore the space and examine different areas of the galaxy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player uses mouse input THEN the system SHALL allow camera rotation around the galaxy center
2. WHEN the player scrolls the mouse wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom the camera in and out smoothly
3. WHEN the player drags with the mouse THEN the system SHALL pan the camera view
4. WHEN the camera moves THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth movement without jarring transitions
5. IF the camera moves too far from the galaxy THEN the system SHALL limit the camera bounds to keep planets visible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my ship's position and movement in 3D space, so that I can track my current location and understand my travel progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player has a current location THEN the system SHALL display the ship as a simple 3D primitive at that planet's position
2. WHEN the player travels between planets THEN the system SHALL animate the ship moving along a path in 3D space
3. WHEN the ship is traveling THEN the system SHALL show a clear visual indication of the travel progress
4. WHEN the ship arrives at a destination THEN the system SHALL position the ship at the destination planet

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with planets in the 3D view, so that I can select destinations and access trading information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks on a planet THEN the system SHALL select that planet and highlight it visually
2. WHEN a planet is selected THEN the system SHALL display the planet's trade information in the UI panels
3. WHEN the player hovers over a planet THEN the system SHALL show a visual hover effect
4. WHEN displaying planet information THEN the system SHALL maintain all current trading data and functionality
5. WHEN a planet is the player's current location THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it from other planets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the 3D galaxy to integrate seamlessly with the existing UI, so that I can continue using all current game features without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 3D galaxy loads THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing UI panels and functionality
2. WHEN the player interacts with the 3D view THEN the system SHALL update the trade panels with relevant information
3. WHEN the player makes trades or purchases THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in both the 3D view and UI panels
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL synchronize updates between the 3D galaxy and the game manager
5. IF the 3D view fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback to the 2D galaxy view
