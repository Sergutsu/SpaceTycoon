# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current static UI layout into a modern, flexible interface system for the Space Transport Tycoon game. The refactor will create a full-screen galaxy map with detachable/foldable panels, responsive design, and a clean top navigation bar. This addresses the need for better screen real estate utilization and improved user experience through customizable interface layouts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want a full-screen galaxy map that I can navigate and scale, so that I can better visualize and interact with the game world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the galaxy map SHALL occupy the full screen area below the top navigation
2. WHEN I use mouse wheel THEN the galaxy map SHALL zoom in/out smoothly with appropriate limits
3. WHEN I click and drag on the galaxy map THEN it SHALL pan/scroll in the direction of the drag
4. WHEN I resize the window THEN the galaxy map SHALL remain responsive and maintain aspect ratio
5. IF the map is zoomed or panned THEN it SHALL remember the view state during the session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want panels that can be folded/collapsed, so that I can customize my interface and focus on what's important.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a panel's fold button THEN the panel SHALL collapse to show only its title bar
2. WHEN I click a collapsed panel's title bar THEN it SHALL expand to show full content
3. WHEN a panel is collapsed THEN it SHALL maintain its position but take minimal vertical space
4. WHEN panels are folded/unfolded THEN the animation SHALL be smooth and not jarring
5. IF I fold multiple panels THEN each SHALL maintain its individual state independently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want panels that can be detached from the main interface, so that I can arrange my workspace according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a panel's title bar THEN it SHALL detach and become a floating window
2. WHEN a panel is detached THEN it SHALL remain functional with all its original features
3. WHEN I close a detached panel THEN it SHALL return to its original docked position
4. WHEN I drag a detached panel to the edge THEN it SHALL offer visual docking hints
5. IF I have multiple detached panels THEN each SHALL be independently movable and resizable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want a clean top navigation bar with essential information, so that I can quickly access key game data without clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the top bar SHALL display credits, fuel, cargo, and game logo
2. WHEN game resources change THEN the top bar SHALL update the values immediately
3. WHEN I resize the window THEN the top bar SHALL remain fixed and responsive
4. WHEN the window is narrow THEN the top bar SHALL adapt layout to prevent overflow
5. IF there are artifact bonuses active THEN they SHALL be indicated in the resource display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want a settings button easily accessible, so that I can quickly access game configuration options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN a settings button SHALL be visible in the top-right corner
2. WHEN I click the settings button THEN it SHALL open a settings panel or menu
3. WHEN the window is resized THEN the settings button SHALL remain in the corner
4. WHEN I hover over the settings button THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback
5. IF the settings panel is open THEN clicking outside SHALL close it

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want the interface to work well on different screen sizes, so that I can play comfortably regardless of my display setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the window is resized THEN all UI elements SHALL scale appropriately
2. WHEN on a small screen THEN panels SHALL automatically stack or resize to fit
3. WHEN on a large screen THEN the interface SHALL utilize the extra space effectively
4. WHEN switching between landscape/portrait THEN the layout SHALL adapt accordingly
5. IF the screen is very narrow THEN non-essential UI elements SHALL be hidden or collapsed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth transitions and animations, so that the interface feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN panels fold/unfold THEN the animation SHALL be smooth and take 0.2-0.3 seconds
2. WHEN panels are dragged THEN they SHALL follow the cursor smoothly without lag
3. WHEN docking hints appear THEN they SHALL fade in/out smoothly
4. WHEN the galaxy map zooms THEN it SHALL animate smoothly to the new scale
5. IF multiple animations occur simultaneously THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want my panel layout preferences to be remembered, so that I don't have to reconfigure the interface every time I play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I fold/unfold panels THEN their states SHALL be saved automatically
2. WHEN I detach panels THEN their positions SHALL be remembered for the session
3. WHEN I restart the game THEN folded panel states SHALL be restored
4. WHEN I resize detached panels THEN their sizes SHALL be remembered
5. IF I reset to defaults THEN all panels SHALL return to their original docked and expanded state
