# Space Transport Tycoon - Design Document

## Project Overview

**Game Title**: Space Transport Tycoon  
**Genre**: Progressive Idle Strategy/Tycoon  
**Platform**: Godot 4.4 (Desktop/Mobile)  
**Development Status**: MVP Development Phase  
**Last Updated**: July 19, 2025

## Revised Core Concept

**Space Transport Tycoon** is a progressive idle strategy game that evolves from active trading simulation to automated galactic empire management. Players begin as hands-on space traders, gradually building automated systems that allow them to focus on exploration, discovery, and cosmic-scale decisions.

### **Evolution Phases**

#### Phase 1: Active Trader (MVP)
- **Manual Trading**: Buy low, sell high across 3-5 star systems
- **Ship Management**: Upgrade vessels, manage fuel and cargo
- **Route Optimization**: Learn profitable trade routes through experience
- **Foundation Building**: Establish first automated trading posts

#### Phase 2: Fleet Commander 
- **Automated Routes**: Set up recurring trade routes with AI captains
- **Fleet Expansion**: Manage multiple specialized ships
- **Station Construction**: Build trading posts and refueling stations
- **Market Manipulation**: Influence supply/demand through strategic trading

#### Phase 3: Galactic Tycoon
- **Idle Economy**: Self-managing trade networks generate passive income
- **Exploration Focus**: Discover ancient artifacts and lost civilizations
- **Cosmic Infrastructure**: Dyson spheres, space elevators, stellar engineering
- **Transcendence Path**: Evolve beyond physical limitations

### **Core Gameplay Pillars**

1. **Progressive Automation**: Start hands-on, gradually automate routine tasks
2. **Meaningful Discovery**: Exploration reveals game-changing artifacts and lore
3. **Economic Mastery**: Deep but accessible supply/demand mechanics
4. **Cosmic Scale**: Progression from single ship to galactic consciousness
5. **Relaxed Pacing**: No time pressure, play at your own pace

### **The Ancient Mystery**
Six precursor civilizations left reality-altering artifacts scattered across the galaxy. Each discovery unlocks new capabilities and reveals fragments of their tragic stories:

- **Chronovores**: Masters of time manipulation (temporal acceleration artifacts)
- **Silica Gardens**: Terraforming specialists (planet transformation tools)
- **Void Weavers**: Space-time architects (wormhole generators)
- **Harmonium**: Quantum resonance builders (efficiency multipliers)
- **Nexus Architects**: Dimensional engineers (teleportation networks)
- **The Last Light**: Energy transcendents (stellar harvesting technology)

## MVP Feature Set & Architecture

### **MVP Goals (Phase 1: Active Trader)**
Create a compelling 2-4 hour gameplay loop that demonstrates the core trading mechanics and sets up the foundation for automation.

#### **Core MVP Features**

1. **Enhanced Galaxy Map (5 Systems)**
   ```gdscript
   # Expanded from current 3 to 5 systems
   var star_systems = {
       "terra_system": {...},      # Agricultural hub
       "minerva_system": {...},    # Mining colony  
       "luxuria_system": {...},    # Tourist destination
       "frontier_outpost": {...},  # High-risk, high-reward
       "nexus_station": {...}      # Central trading hub
   }
   ```

2. **Ship Upgrade System**
   ```gdscript
   # Ship progression system
   var ship_upgrades = {
       "cargo_capacity": [50, 75, 100, 150, 200],
       "fuel_efficiency": [1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6],
       "speed": [1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5],
       "scanner_range": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # For artifact discovery
   }
   ```

3. **Artifact Discovery System**
   ```gdscript
   # Simple artifact system for MVP
   var artifacts = {
       "chronovore_fragment": {
           "effect": "reduce_travel_time",
           "magnitude": 0.1,

   # First step toward idle mechanics
   var trading_posts = {
       "auto_buy_threshold": 0.8,   # Buy when price < 80% of average
       "auto_sell_threshold": 1.2,  # Sell when price > 120% of average
       "efficiency": 0.7            # 70% of manual trading profit
   }
   ```

5. **Event System**

signal price_changed(planet_id: String, good_type: String, new_price: int)

# ShipSystem.gd  
extends Node
class_name ShipSystem

class_name ArtifactSystem
signal artifact_discovered(artifact_id: String, location: String)
```

## Design Philosophy

### **Core Principles**
1. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add depth gradually
2. **Meaningful Automation**: Automation enhances rather than replaces gameplay
3. **Discovery-Driven**: Exploration and artifacts provide major progression moments
4. **Economic Realism**: Supply/demand creates emergent strategic opportunities
5. **Relaxed Pacing**: No time pressure, play at your own pace

### **Player Experience Goals**
- **Session 1**: Learn trading basics, make first profits, discover first artifact
- **Session 2-3**: Upgrade ship, explore all systems, set up first automation
- **Session 4-5**: Master market dynamics, find rare artifacts, plan fleet expansion
- **Long-term**: Transition to fleet management and cosmic-scale thinking

### **Monetization Strategy (Future)**
- **Premium Version**: Advanced automation features, cosmetic ship designs
- **DLC Expansions**: New galaxy sectors, precursor civilizations
- **No Pay-to-Win**: All gameplay advantages earned through play

This revised design document provides a clear path from the current prototype to a compelling MVP that demonstrates the game's unique progression from active trading to idle empire management, while maintaining the mysterious ancient civilization theme that will drive long-term engagement.
